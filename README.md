# Hi there!
<div class="rec noise"></div>
My name is Elena, a frontend developer always learning about my passion, programming. 

I love to explore new knowledge and increase my background. You can find it here from Vue.js or React, to Bash or Swift. I love Docker and Kubernetes, clean code, and find the business logic to keep it far from my application logic. I know I have a lot to learn in the future, and I love it!

I don't like to use CSS libraries. I like CSS as it is. 

I teach courses sometimes, and here I have resources for these courses too. 

Using Linux usually, I tried different distributions, and I love all of them. 
I like to write my custom bash scripts to automatize some stuff, but they are just personal. And of course, I take care of my privacy, so is quite difficult to find me on social media. 

Hope you like what you see here, and pls, if you can help me to improve my knowledge, please, do it. ^.^
